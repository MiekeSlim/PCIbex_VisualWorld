Typically, expensive eye-tracking devices are used to record eye movements. The aim of this experiment is to test whether we could also use webcams to achieve this goal. <br><br>The task is very simple and should take roughly 25-30 minutes to complete (there will be a break in the middle). All you have to do is listen to short sentences while four images are presented on your computer screen. Feel free to look anywhere, as long as it is on your computer screen. Your webcam will be used to follow your eye movements on the task. <br><br>We will <b>not</b> collect any video data or any other type of data that may reveal your identity. We only collect data on where on the screen your eyes are looking during the experiment.<br><br>Unfortunately, the experiment may not work for everyone: Sometimes the webcam is not able to pick up your eye movements (for a variety of possible reasons). We will test in a moment whether the experiment works for you. In case it doesnâ€™t, you will be redirected to another experiment in which you will judge English sentences (which doesn't require a webcam). This way, you can still earn your reward on Prolific.<br><br>It is important that you are in a well-lit and quiet environment, otherwise the webcam may not be able to pick up your eye movements. Please turn off any devices or applications that may distract you during this task (such as your mobile phone or your email application) and please close other websites that you may have open.<br><br>If you have any questions about this experiment, feel free to get in touch with me (Mieke Slim) via email: mieke.slim@ugent.be")
